# IMDB Binary Text Classification

This project uses an IMDB dataset to perform binary text classification. The goal is to predict whether a review is positive or negative using different machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the following link: [IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). It consists of more than 25,000 movie reviews with labeled sentiments.


## Requirements
Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* imbalanced-learn

## Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the IMDB_binary_text_classification.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Make sure the IMDB Dataset.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Execute each cell in the notebook to load the data, balance the classes, split the data into training and test sets, and train the models.
5. Choose one of the models (SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and adjust the hyperparameters if desired.
6. Use the selected model to make predictions on new movie reviews.
7. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

That's it! Now you can explore the project, modify the code, or adapt it to your own needs. If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue in this repository.
